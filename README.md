# Training-xor-on-neural-network
In this project, i trained a 2 input xor function using single hidden layer neural network. I used keras running on top of tensorflow for neural network training. Since, its a binary classification task, i used sigmoid as activation function on last layer. The network trains and validates output perfectly. The test data is embedded inside the code for predicting values on the trained model.
